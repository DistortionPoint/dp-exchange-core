# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Status: EXPERIMENTAL

Stated here rather than only per-release, because a reader arriving at a specific
version needs it as much as one reading the top.

This package has not run in production. While it is `0.x` the API may change without a
major version — pin three-part (`~> 0.1.0`). Coverage is uneven by design: fakes and
live public endpoints are well covered, order placement and authenticated flows are
not.

**Whenever an endpoint moves to `:proven`, the entry that does it states the evidence** —
which venue, what was run against it, and when. "Marked proven" with no evidence is not
an acceptable changelog line.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repo foundation: toolchain pin, `.gitignore`, formatter, credo, license, `mix.exs`,
  config layout, CI workflow, design-docs scaffolding.
